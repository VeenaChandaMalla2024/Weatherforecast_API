Weather Forecast API contains  API to add temperature based on date and retieve them based on chosen dates.
My assumption of calulating forecast summary is  as below
              Freezing -40 to 60
              Bracing -30-40
              Chilly -20-30
              Cool -10- 0
              Mild 0-10
              Warm 10-20
              Balmy 20-30
              Hot 30-40
              Sweltering 40-50
              Scorching 50-60
Authorization of API is not yet implemented which shouldn't be the case(I would need some more time to do this)
For some reason , I couldn't add xUnit test case project to solution via git command/visual studio, so I added files manually.
